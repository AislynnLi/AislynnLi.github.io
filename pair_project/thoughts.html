        <summary>"History"</summary>
        Net.art developed in a context of cultural crisis in Eastern Europe after the end of the Soviet Union and the fall of the Berlin Wall. It also came just in time for governments and large companies in various countries to start operating on the Internet. So the artists developed a strong sense of social responsibility and chose the Internet as a medium of expression.

        <summary>"Web 1.0"</summary>
        Web 1.0 is all about reading and finding information. It allows one-way communication from the creator to the user, which means, web 1.0 lacks interactivity. We think form-art adds interactivity (form-art competition) on the plain boxes and lines. It forseens the advent of web 2.0 in a way.

        “Bringing them in focus was a declaration of the fact that a computer interface is not a “transparent” invisible layer to be taken for granted, but something that defines the way we are forced to work and even think. And that it is made by the technology developers.”
